JenniferM,5.0,No,"Great TV for the money, Did not want to spend $1000 for our bonus room. It’s easy to setup and program. No complaints very happy and curb side pickup was great they were fast, friendly and helpful. This TV picture is just as great if not better than my Samsung frame TV and I like the WebOS and the App Store better on this LG than my Samsung."
Emgee,5.0,Yes,"Product was delivered with care and on time. I availed the best buy support team to assist in carrying the TV setting up. The team is professional and friendly as well. 
The TV is good. Picture is crisp. Sounds are awesome."
DoreenM,5.0,No,Love my LG 65 inch TV. clear picture great sound very happy with my purchase
DawnP,5.0,No,"Works great ,color vibrant. Very happy with choice. Salesman was wonderful"
NagarajuR,5.0,Yes,The TV works great and i had to return the TV because of the TV remote which i am not comfortable. The remote has lot of keys which i never use and hard to operate. Just look at the ROKU tv remote whcih is fantastic and it has best tv remote app. Not sure why LG does not make smart remotes. The TV is really great but Remote sucks.
JSMScreens,5.0,No,"The **LG 65” Class UT70 Series LED 4K UHD Smart webOS TV (2024)** is an excellent choice for anyone seeking a high-quality viewing experience. The 4K UHD resolution delivers stunning picture clarity, while the LED technology ensures vibrant colors and deep blacks. The webOS platform is user-friendly and offers a wide range of apps and streaming services. Additionally, the sleek design and slim bezels make it a stylish addition to any living room. Overall, this TV provides great value for its price."
Mcesar45,5.0,Yes,This tv really surprised us we didn’t expect the picture to be so vivid an alive. Best purchase ever. The price was right.
Mormanmommy,3.0,No,"We purchased this TV for our bedroom. The size is great and I overall like the TV. The remote however is very hard to navigate, a ton of buttons that don't make sense. I also have problems when I switch over to my fire stick, a video sound will start playing as soon as I switch input to my fire stick. I wish that this TV had the option for the downloader app but it doesn't. For the price it's a decent TV."
3950,5.0,Yes,"Excellent picture. Easy set up. Sound is ok, but perfect with external speakers."
lawson,4.0,No,"I'm quite impressed with this tvs performance so far. This TV has Chromecast if that's what you need or want. I'm not sure if the people complaining about apps loading slowly are just being dramatic. Sure, the apps don't load as snappy as Roku but I didn't have to wait more than a five or six seconds for any app to load so far. I did notice when you hit the settings button there is a bit of a lag but it's a mild inconvenience. 

The TV speakers sound decent but I'm still using my sound bar. When you get the tv it's in energy savings mode, you'll need to go into the settings to turn it off or the TV won't appear as bright as it can be. 

If you're looking for a basic 4k uhd tv this one is a good pick for the price you're paying."
goirish581,4.0,No,"Good TV for the money. Bought this for my mother-in-law. She loves it. Wouldn’t appreciate an OLED. LG got this one right for a fair price. Looks good out of the box. Easy to wall mount. Sound is also decent, but hooked up a soundbar anyway. They play well together."
StephanieS,5.0,No,Purchased this for my 2nd living room. It has a beautiful picture and so many features. My grandchildren are going to be happy when they come over to play the PS5 on it. I am a very happy customer

Cedric,5.0,No,Great tv picture was clear easy to setup my favorite feature was the built in web browser
MauricioH,5.0,No,"This TV really impressed with its stunning picture quality as it provides rich colors and deep blacks that enhances any viewing experience. The webOS platform is intuitive and fast, providing seamless access to streaming apps and features. The built-in sound is solid but pairing it with a soundbar may provide a more immersive audio experience."

AngelaB,1.0,Yes,"I recently purchased an LG 65"" TV from Best Buy, and it has been nothing short of a frustrating experience. The remote that came with the TV does not support the advanced features of the television, making it impossible to access HDMI for gaming or other essential functions. When I reached out to customer service for help, they informed me that I would need to pay an additional $200 for set up assistance and buy  a compatible remote. & I  am a paid member of the annual geek squad repair services! This is completely unacceptable for such an expensive product. I am now left wanting a full refund and a bottle of Excedrin for the headache this ordeal has caused me. Save yourself the trouble and shop elsewhere!"
JayKay,5.0,No,Very happy with our purchase. Light but sturdy. This is our second LG TV and couldn’t be more please. Easy unboxing and friendly user manual. Would buy LG again. And the price point was a killer too!
Macro47,4.0,No,"The TV is great. However, you cannot pair an older Magic remote with it, and sometimes, the interface seems a bit slow and laggy. It has a Great Picture and a nice, thin border, and it is easy to set up."
Nic2,5.0,No,I always purchase LG televisions. This one did not disappoint.  The color is great and the sound is awesome.  The sound compliments my LG soundbar.

Joshua1958,1.0,Yes,"While I am quite happy with the TV itself, the customer service was the worst that I could have anticipated.  At the time of the pickup, I was scheduled for open heart triple bypass surgery. My daughter and I arrived at the Best Buy in Germantown, MD, in my Jeep Cherokee with a roof rack. We requested that the TV be placed on the roof rack and that we would tie it down. Your associates stated that they could not do that and said that if we dropped the back seats, that they believed they could squeeze the TV in the back. I said that I did not believe it would fit, but essentially told either that or that they would not help put the TV on the roof.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and they attempted to shove the TV inside the back. It stuck out the back rather dangerously. They said that if my daughter and I moved the front seats as far as possible, that maybe it would work. I moved the driver seat as far forward as possible, barely being able to fit behind the steering wheel. Also, in the process, your associates badly scruffed the inside of my newly purchased Jeep Cherokee Limited. They had the audacity to ask if they could do anything else, and I said no, that they had NOT been helpfully. I used the rope I purchased to put the TV on the roof to tie down the hatchback as far as possible. I did not feel safe driving home under those conditions, but had no option. Once we got back home, my wife had to help our daughter and I get the TV out of the vehicle; made very difficult, thanks to your associates. Upon unloading the TV, We saw that the interior was badly scuffed. I will most likely NEVER buy another product from Best Buy and have begun to tell friends my experience. FYI - I am a Rewards member."
AndreI,3.0,No,"Overall it’s not a bad tv, but if you want to youse browsing it’s the nightmare…"
MiguelM,2.0,No,Tv could have came with a better remote control than the traditional one.
Alireza,2.0,No,good quality pictures  but very slowly progressing in open application
KevinUTAH,1.0,Yes,"Why You Shouldn't Buy 2024 LG UT70 ;(
Bottom Line: ""The LG UT7570 is an entry-level TV released in 2024. It's a 60Hz option and doesn't have modern features like local dimming, VRR support, or HDMI 2.1 bandwidth""

The LG UT7570 is just okay for ‘mixed’ usage.
Unfortunately, it has awful contrast and doesn't get bright enough for use in a well-lit room, so it doesn't look very good regardless of the lighting in your room.""  The TV's response time is only decent, so fast motion has noticeable blur behind it.  If you're looking for a TV to pair with your modern gaming console or PC, it isn't a good option since it lacks HDMI 2.1 bandwidth, 4k @ 120Hz, and VRR support; you're limited to 4k @ 60Hz.

VERY Slow smart interface.  Cheap & below the standarrds of minimum acceptable TV we recommend.  Not worth you're time.

Build Quality:  The TV comes with two plastic feet. They're set wide apart and can't be adjusted, so they take up a lot of space, and you'll need a large cabinet for the larger sizes. The stand lifts the display about 2.91 inches above the table, so most soundbars fit underneath without blocking the screen."" 

The inputs are housed in a much smaller box than the LG UQ7590, which gives the back of the TV a cleaner look. Since the inputs are located in the middle, they're hard to reach if you have the TV wall-mounted. Unfortunately, there are no clips or anything to help with cable management.

The TV has decent build quality overall. It's mostly made of plastic, so it's light and feels a bit cheap, but the two feet hold the TV well enough that there are no major issues with stability. Unfortunately, my unit does have some uneven assembly near the top of the screen, so there's a small gap between the screen and the borders of the TV.


Contrast & Brightness:  The LG UT75 has awful contrast. Blacks are raised and look gray when highlights are also on the screen, and the TV lacks a local dimming feature to improve its contrast. Switching to Game Optimizer doesn't result in any noticeable difference in dark scene performance.  It has inadequate HDR brightness. It's not bright enough to display HDR content properly. Bright highlights don't stand out, and overall, this TV doesn't provide an impactful HDR experience."" 

*****The TV has disappointing SDR brightness. It's not bright enough to overcome glare in a well-lit room, so it's best suited for dark or moderately lit rooms.*****

Color Gamut/Volume:  The LG UT7570 has an okay color gamut, but it's not wide enough to display saturated colors in HDR.  All colors are undersaturated and very inaccurate.

The TV's color volume is mediocre. It does a bad job at displaying dark colors due to its awful contrast, and the TV isn't nearly bright enough to display colors at high luminance levels.


So… The LG UT75 has disappointing black uniformity, since the entire screen is blueish and cloudy."" 

The TV's gradient handling is adequate. There's some noticeable banding in dark grays, dark reds, dark blues, and bright greens, and dark greens have significant banding. It’s low-quality content smoothing is good. Details are preserved well, but there's still some noticeable macro blocking in dark scenes.
The LG UT7570 does an okay job at upscaling low-resolution content like DVDs or lower-resolution streams. Details aren't overly soft, but finer details are very hard to make out.

The TV uses pulse width modulation (PWM) to dim its backlight, which introduces flicker that can bother people who are sensitive to it. Unfortunately, it flickers at a slow 120Hz in all picture modes and at all brightness levels, so it can cause headaches and eye strain if you're sensitive to flicker.
Hard Facts - No Local Dimming, 60 Hz, Horrid Brightness = No Thanks
There are better choices.

First & Foremost - 8K is POINTLESS in 2024 Still

General Reasons Why -

1. Lack of Content - There barely is enough 4K Content available, let alone 8K Content. Upscaling 720p or 1080p to 2160p is hard enough for some tv's let alone upscaling to 4320p

2. Value - You get far better value out of a 4K TV

3. HDMI 2.1 is still in its infancy and most tv's only can do 40GBPs not the full 48 GBPs of HDMI 2.1. HDMI 2.0 is limited to 8K@30. HDMI 2.1 is limited to 8K@60 as well."
Rmendoza,5.0,No,"Good tv for the price
Wife love it
No grabbing local channels but other than that great tv"
LoriG,5.0,No,New TV - great picture very clear and easy to set up - Love it!!
NayeliG,5.0,Yes,Perfect purchase for Xmas! 110% recommended would do it again
Layne,1.0,No,"Don’t waste your money unless you want a slow TV. Shouldn’t be labeled a smart TV, it’s so slow, it’s insane. Ours is only a couple months old and it takes 10 plus minutes (literally) to open Hulu and watch a show. The only thing it’s good for is if you have an Xbox, fire stick, or some kid of third party add on to use. The TV is painfully slow. I don’t recommend it"
